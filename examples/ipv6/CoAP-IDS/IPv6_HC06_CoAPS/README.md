6LoWPAN (HC06 Compression) with UDP and CoAP
Tentative:  Tiny-CoAPS
===================================================

This should be a module with CoAP and DTLS. 
Taken as reference the work of Lithe. Basically, should be an upgrade
from the old code for erbium, contiki and TinyDTLS. 


However, is having issues:

1. TinyDTLs is giving problems (see '../IPv6_HC06_TinyDTLS/README.md' )
2. Probably there is an error in er-coaps from my part. 

The number 2 could be fixed, but because the problem with point 1 I'll leave
this project alone and focus on RIOT.
