# Lesson 2: IPv6/6LoWPAN networking basics

The following examples will show how to start developing wireless applications in Contiki, using UDP IPv6/6LoWPAN.

The examples are written to be followed in order, so be sure to start from the very first and make your way to the last in an ordered fashion.

## Lession objectives

The objective of the lessions are:
